# Analyze Bay Area Bike Share Data
## Project Submission
Congratulations on completing P0! Now for the moment you’ve been waiting for... time to get feedback from a Udacity Reviewer and see how you did! Let’s just go through a few quick checks to make sure all our i's are dotted and t's are crossed.

## Check Your Submission Against the Rubric
We will use this rubric to evaluate your project. Take a quick minute to make sure you’ve covered each item in your submission. Try to feel that your project meets specifications on all rubric points before you submit your work.

Remember that this project is meant to provide you with a quick opportunity to experience the submission process and feedback for your learning. You’re not required to meet specifications on this project, although you are welcome to resubmit until you meet specifications if you like.

## Submit Your Project for Review
To get your project prepared for submission, it is recommended that you save it in a format that will make it easy for others to read. You can use the **File -> Download as -> HTML (.html)** menu to save your notebook as an .html file. If you get an error about "No module name", then open a terminal and try installing the missing module using pip install <module_name> (don't include the "<" or ">" or any words following a period in the module name).

For this particular project, you only need to submit the completed report; you do not need to submit the supplemental scripts or data files. When you’re ready, click the “Submit Project” button below!
