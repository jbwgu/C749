# Design an A/B Test
## Project Submission
Make design decisions for an A/B test, including which metrics to measure and how long the test should be run. Analyze the results of an A/B test that was run by Udacity and recommend whether or not to launch the change.

**NOTE:** This project is optional for students in cohorts Nov. 2014-April 2015. For students in later cohorts, it is required.

## Evaluation
Use the Project Rubric to review your project. If you are happy with your submission, then you are ready to submit! If you see room for improvement in any category in which you do not meet specifications, keep working!

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to the same Project Rubric. Your project must "meet specifications" or "exceed specifications" in each category in order for your submission to pass.

## Submission
Ready to submit your project? First, make sure you have correctly answered all the quizzes in the final project lesson of the A/B testing course. Then, go back to your Udacity Home, click on the project, and follow the instructions to submit!

- You can either send us a GitHub link of the files or upload a compressed directory (zip file).
- Inside the zip folder include a text file with a list of Web sites, books, forums, blog posts, etc. that you referred to or used in this submission (Add N/A if you did not use such resources).

It can take us up to a week to grade the project, but in most cases it is much faster. You will receive an email once your submission has been reviewed.

If you are having any problems submitting your project or wish to check on the status of your submission, please email us at dataanalyst-project@udacity.com.

## What to include in your submission?
Besides correctly answering each quiz in the final project lesson, you should upload the following files via the portal:

1. A pdf or html file with your report on the experiment design and analysis. Your report should be organized as in this template.
2. A list of Web sites, books, forums, blog posts, etc. that you referred to or used in creating your submission (add N/A if you did not use any such resources).
