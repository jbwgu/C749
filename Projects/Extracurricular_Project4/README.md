# Make Effective Data Visualization
## Project Submission
Create a data visualization from a data set that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in the data. Use either dimple.js or d3.js to create the visualization. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

## Evaluation
Use the Project Rubric to review your project. If you are happy with your submission, then you are ready to submit! If you see room for improvement in **any** category in which you do not meet specifications, keep working!

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to the same Project Rubric. Your project must "meet specifications" or "exceed specifications" in each category in order for your submission to pass.

## Reminders
- Your visualization work should use dimple.js or d3.js: other visualization libraries may not be evaluatable by reviewers.
- Remember that your visualization should be explanatory in nature and communicate specific results that you want to show.
