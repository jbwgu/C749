# Create a Tableau Story
Create a data visualization that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in a data set. Use Tableau to create the visualization. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

## Evaluation
Use the Project Rubric to review your project. If you are happy with your submission, then you are ready to submit! If you see room for improvement in any category in which you do not meet specifications, keep working!

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to the same Project Rubric. Your project must "Meet Specifications" in each category in order for your submission to pass.

## Reminders
- Your visualization work should use Tableau: other visualization tools may not be evaluatable by reviewers.
- Remember that your visualization should be explanatory in nature and communicate specific results that you want to show.

## Submission
Ready to submit your project? Click on the "Submit Project" button or go back to your Udacity Home and click on the project, then follow the instructions to submit! Make sure you include the following files and information:

- A PDF or Markdown write up that includes the following sections:
  - links to the first version of your story (e.g. story_v1) and final version of your story (e.g. story_final)
  - **Summary:** brief description of the visualization and the main story or findings conveyed
  - **Design:** explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback
  - **Feedback:** feedback received from others from the first sketch to the final visualization
  - **Resources:** list of Web sites, books, forums, blog posts, GitHub repositories etc that you referred to or used in this submission (Add N/A if you did not use such resources).
- The final data set file used for the graphic (usually .csv)

It can take us up to a week to grade this project, but in most cases it is much faster. You will receive an email when your submission has been reviewed.
