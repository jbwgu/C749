# Test a Perceptual Phenomenon
Use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology. Give your readers a good intuition for the data and use statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results.

## Evaluation
Once you have a document answering the questions on the previous page, be sure to check through the project rubric before you submit your report. Your project will be evaluated as “meets specifications” only if it meets specifications in all the criteria. If you see any category where you do not meet specifications, make sure you revise your report to meet the rubric criteria.

## Submission
Ready to submit your project? Collect the following files:

- A PDF or HTML file with answers to the 5 questions that were posed in the Project Notebook and on the previous page.
- A list of websites, books, forums, GitHub repositories, and other resources (web or otherwise) that you referred to or used in this submission. This can be attached to the bottom of your answers document or placed in a separate plain text file (add N/A if not included).
- (Optional) Any code or other documents that you used to compute statistics for completing the project tasks.

Then click on the Submit Project button at the bottom of this page.

- If you want to submit your files through a "Link to Project", upload your project files onto Github and send us the link.
- If you instead want to submit your files through "Upload a Zip", compress your project directory, and submit that zip file.

It can take us up to a week to grade the project so keep checking back for updates.
