# Optimize Your GitHub Profile
## Project Submission
GitHub Profiles are a key piece of "evidence" to an employer that you'd be a good job candidate, because they can see the details of your work. Recruiters use GitHub as a way to find job candidates, and many Nanodegree alumni have received work opportunities from their activity on GitHub. In addition, using GitHub is a way for you to collaborate on projects with other programmers - this will show that you are able to work well with others on an engineering team on the job.

## Submission Instructions
1. Submit this project after you've done some continuous coding for two weeks, so the reviewer will be able to comment on trends.
2. Submit your GitHub profile URL as your project.
3. If you'd like to **opt-out** of this project, please read the instructions underneath the divider line, below.
