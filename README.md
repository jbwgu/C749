This section consists of all the lessons (9 PARTS) and projects (6 PROJECTS) you need to complete in order to receive your certificate.

## PART 1
### Welcome to the Nanodegree
Get started on your Nanodegree and learn how to make the most of Udacity's resources!

You’ll also do your first project analyzing bike rental data. It’s a great project to tackle during the first week in your Nanodegree to see if the program is a good fit for you!

## PART 2
### Descriptive Statistics
Learn to use descriptive statistics to describe properties of datasets and learn about how samples and populations are related.

## PART 3
### Intro to Data Analysis
Choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and Pandas. Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings.

- Project: Investigate a Dataset
- [Project Repository](Projects/Project1/)

## PART 4
### Data Wrangling
Choose a region of the world from www.openstreetmap.org and then use data wrangling techniques to audit and clean the data. You'll then use a database to query the cleaned data.

- Project: Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data
- [Project Repository](Projects/Project2/)

## PART 5
### Exploratory Data Analysis
Use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and relationships.

- Project: Explore and Summarize Data
- [Project Repository](Projects/Project3/)

## PART 6
### Inferential Statistics
Use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology.

- Project: Test a Perceptual Phenomenon
- [Project Repository](Projects/Project4/)

## PART 7
### Intro to Machine Learning
Play detective and put your machine learning skills to use by building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

- Project: Identify Fraud from Enron Email
- [Project Repository](Projects/Project5/)

## PART 8
### Data Visualization in Tableau
Understand the importance of data visualization. Know how different data types are encoded in visualizations. Select the most effective chart or graph based on the data being displayed.

- Project: Create a Tableau Story
- [Project Repository](Projects/Project6/)

## PART 9
### Matrix Math & NumPy Refresher

# Extracurricular
This section consists of extra lessons (13 PARTS) and projects (4 PROJECTS) you can choose to complete in order to increase your chances of changing careers.

## PART 1
### Analyze Bay Area Bikeshare Data
- Project: Analyze Bay Area Bike Share Data
- [Project Repository](Projects/Extracurricular_Project1/)

## PART 2
### How to use Git and GitHub
Learn how to use version control to save and share your projects with others.

## PART 3
### GitHub Profile
Technical recruiters commonly use GitHub as a recruiting platform. They are looking for activity, consistency, and communication in addition to your overall projects. Look at your GitHub profile through the lens of a recruiter or hiring manager, focusing on how your profile, projects, and code represent you as a potential candidate for a company or collaborator on a project.

- Project: Optimize Your GitHub Profile
- [Project Repository](Projects/Extracurricular_Project2/)

## PART 4
### Career: Data Analyst Interview Practice
Now that you've practiced your skills through your project work, learn how you can present your knowledge in an interview.

## PART 5
### Career: Job Search Strategies
Opportunity can come when you least expect it, so when your dream job comes along, you want to be ready.

## PART 6
### Career: Networking

## PART 7
### MongoDB
Learn how to query data and make use of the non-relational database system, MongoDB.

## PART 8
### [Optional] A/B Testing
Make design decisions for an A/B test, including which metrics to measure and how long the test should be run. Analyze the results of an A/B test that was run by Udacity and recommend whether or not to launch the change.

- Project: Design an A/B Test
- [Project Repository](Projects/Extracurricular_Project3/)

## PART 9
### [Optional] Data Visualization in D3
Create a data visualization from a data set that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in the data. Use either dimple.js or d3.js to create the visualization. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

- Project: Make Effective Data Visualization
- [Project Repository](Projects/Extracurricular_Project4/)

## PART 10
### [Optional] Introduction to Python
Get started writing Python with this introductory course.

## PART 11
### Intro to Data Analysis
Learn the data analysis process of questioning, wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data. Learn how to work with data in Python using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.

## PART 12
### Practical Statistics
Learn how to apply inferential statistics and probability to important, real-world scenarios, such as analyzing A/B tests and building supervised learning models.

## PART 13
### Data Wrangling
Learn the data wrangling process of gathering, assessing, and cleaning data. Learn how to use Python to wrangle data programmatically and prepare it for deeper analysis.
